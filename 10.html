<p>The Blessed Lord said: Listen again to my divine teachings, O mighty armed one. Desiring your welfare because you are my beloved friend, I shall reveal them to you.</p>
<p><strong>10.2</strong></p>
<p>Neither celestial gods nor the great sages know my origin. I am the source from which the gods and great seers come.</p>
<p><strong>10.3</strong></p>
<p>Those who know me as unborn and beginningless, and as the Supreme Lord of the universe, they among mortals are free from illusion and released from all evils.</p>
<p><strong>10.4-5</strong></p>
<p>From me alone arise the varieties in the qualities amongst humans, such as intellect, knowledge, clarity of thought, forgiveness, truthfulness, control over the senses and mind, joy and sorrow, birth and death, fear and courage, non-violence, equanimity, contentment, austerity, charity, fame, and infamy.</p>
<p><strong>10.6</strong></p>
<p>The seven great Sages, the four great Saints before them, and the fourteen <em>Manus</em>, are all born from my mind. From them, all the people in the world have descended.</p>
<p><strong>10.7</strong></p>
<p>Those who know in truth my glories and divine powers become united with me through unwavering devotion. Of this there is no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>10.8</strong></p>
<p>I am the origin of all creation. Everything proceeds from me. The wise who know this perfectly worship me with great faith and devotion.</p>
<p><strong>10.9</strong></p>
<p>With their minds fixed on me and their lives surrendered to me, my devotees remain ever contented in me. They derive great satisfaction and bliss in enlightening one another about me, and conversing about my glories.</p>
<p><strong>10.10</strong></p>
<p>To those whose minds are always united with me in loving devotion, I give the divine knowledge by which they can attain me.</p>
<p><strong>10.11</strong></p>
<p>Out of compassion for them, I, who dwell within their hearts, destroy the darkness born of ignorance, with the luminous lamp of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>10.12-13</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Divine Personality, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme Purifier, the Eternal God, the Primal Being, the Unborn, and the Greatest. The great sages, like Narad, Asit, Deval, and Vyas, proclaimed this, and now you are declaring it to me yourself.</p>
<p><strong>10.14</strong></p>
<p>O Krishna, I totally accept everything you have told me as the truth. O Lord, neither gods nor the demons can understand your true personality.</p>
<p><strong>10.15</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, you alone know yourself by your inconceivable energy, O Supreme Personality, the Creator and Lord of all beings, the God of gods, and the Lord of the universe!</p>
<p><strong>10.16-17</strong></p>
<p>Please describe to me your divine opulences, by which you pervade all the worlds and reside in them. O Supreme, how may I know you and think of you. And while meditating, in what forms can I think of you, O Supreme Divine Personality?</p>
<p><strong>10.18</strong></p>
<p>Tell me again in detail your divine glories and manifestations, O Janardan. I can never tire of hearing your nectar.</p>
<p><strong>10.19</strong></p>
